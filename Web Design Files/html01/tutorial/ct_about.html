<blockquote>
    <p>The culinary art of the food truck vendor has been steadily 
        improving over the last 10 years with fine offerings from 
        Antonio's Italian, Organic on the Road, and now Curbside Thai. 
        Sajja Adulet is to be congratulated for offering delicious 
        and authentic Thai food at a reasonable price. We think 
        Curbside Thai provides the finest Asian food on or off 
        the streets of Charlotte.</p>

Steaming rice with a spicy Asian sauce is common street fare 
and we all accept its limitations in exchange for the 
convenience of a quick bite on the run. With Curbside Thai you 
don't have to compromise. Building on his experience as a 
master chef at several fine establishments on the East Coast, 
Sajja Adulet has brought the taste of fine dining to the 
Food Cart Wars and we couldn't be happier.
