Curbside Thai brings the rich flavor of Thailand to 
North Carolina. Master Chef Sajja Adulet, with over 35 
years of experience at the House of Asia, now offers 
that same fine dining to the streets of Charlotte 
with our modern mobile food truck.

This is not bland vendor food packaged in greasy 
paper boxes! Sample his acclaimed cuisine at our various 
mobile locations throughout downtown Charlotte from 
11 a.m. to 7 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and 
11 a.m. to 11 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Taste the 
difference! If you can't get away from your desk, 
Curbside Thai will deliver.

Contact us to cater your next party and experience 
what Carolina Traveler calls the finest Asian food 
on or off the streets of Charlotte
